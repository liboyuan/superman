to `_.pick` from lodash / underscore.\n\nYou might also be interested in [object.omit](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/object.omit).\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install object.pick --save\n```\n\n## benchmarks\n\nThis is the [fastest implementation](http://jsperf.com/pick-props) I tested. Pull requests welcome!\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar pick = require('object.pick');\n\npick({a: 'a', b: 'b'}, 'a')\n//=> {a: 'a'}\n\npick({a: 'a', b: 'b', c: 'c'}, ['a', 'b'])\n//=> {a: 'a', b: 'b'}\n```\n\n## Related projects\n\n* [extend-shallow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extend-shallow): Extend an object with the properties of additional objects. node.js/javascript util. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/extend-shallow)\n* [get-value](https://www.npmjs.com/package/get-value): Use property paths (`  a.b.c`) to get a nested value from an object. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/get-value)\n* [mixin-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mixin-deep): Deeply mix the properties of objects into the first object.
